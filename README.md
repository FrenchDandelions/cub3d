This is our cub3D.

You can compile the mandatory part using ```make``` and the bonus part using ```make bonus```.

After compiling the program, execute the executable and pick a map in either the directory ```maps``` or ```maps_bonus```.

To hide/show the minimap you can press ```m```, to block/unblock the mouse movement you can press ```l```.

To open/close doors in the bonus map you can press ```space```, and in case you forgot where the door is, check the minimap.
